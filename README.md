# IS_CSharp_Examples
A repository to store C# Examples as I create them.
The projects in this repository are C# applications designed and
coded by me, Irene Smith, as part of a development portfolio.

Tipster is a simple tip calculator. It takes the total amount of the meal, the tip percentage, and the number of diners and then calculates the amount of the tip, the total meal cost, and the amount per diner. It is a simple WPF application that uses styles. It was created as a simple exercise in WPF user interface design. Although it may receive some tweaks, it is reasonably complete.
